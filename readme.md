##Description

This is a class implementation of the wp.tuts+ tutorial: http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creative-coding/how-to-use-radio-buttons-with-taxonomies/

To use it, just add to your functions.php and add the javascript file to your theme’s js folder (call it radiotax.js). 

Better still, make make a plug-in out of it, including the javascript file., and being sure to point the wp_register_script to radiotax.js in your plug-in folder.

The class constants are: 
- taxonomy: the taxonomy slug
- taxonomy_metabox_id: the ID of the original taxonomy metabox
- post type - the post type the metabox appears on
