## Description

This plugin is an evolution of the class by Stephen Harris:  
https://github.com/stephenh1988/Radio-Buttons-for-Taxonomies

It has been expanded to provide a plugin options page where the user can select which taxonomies she'd like to switch to using the custom radio-button style metabox.  

## Installation

1. Upload the `plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Settings>Radio Buttons for Taxonomies and use the checkboxes to indicate which taxonomies you'd like to use radio buttons  

## Screenshots
